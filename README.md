# Face Detection with OpenCV

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **real-time face detection** using OpenCV and Python. It captures webcam video, detects faces using a pre-trained Haar Cascade model, and displays bounding boxes around detected faces live.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam  
- Uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier  
- No training required — pre-trained model used  
- Displays bounding boxes on detected faces  

## 🛠️ Installation

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib (optional)

(Optional but recommended: create a virtual environment)

## ▶️ Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook: `Face_Detection.ipynb`
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Make sure your webcam is on.
4. Press `q` to stop the detection loop.

## 📈 Performance

- Runs in real-time (~20–30 FPS on CPU)
- Works best with frontal faces in good lighting
